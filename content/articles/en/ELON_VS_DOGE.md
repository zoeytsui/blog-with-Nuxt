Doge rose a modest 6% on Friday (July 9, 2021) and continued with small gains over the weekend after Dogefather told Twitter that Dogecoin could do a better job of paying than Bitcoin or Ether.

Dogefather is here to support his babies, although Doge started with a joke but Doge quickly rose to the top of the crypto world, maybe Doge has grown up and doesn't need much protection anymore. On Friday, Musk responded to a fan expressing excitement about an upcoming protocol upgrade, commenting on all the ways the upgrade will put Doge ahead of the likes of Bitcoin and Ether.

Elon has been a big supporter of upgrades for a while, sending prices up 15 percent on May 14 after revealing support for the upgrade, which tech titans have said. made strides in making the Doge "the currency of the Earth".
