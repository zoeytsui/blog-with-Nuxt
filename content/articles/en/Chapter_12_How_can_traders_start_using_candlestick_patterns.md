A trader can start using candlestick patterns by simply looking at the candlestick chart of a stock they want to buy or sell. Knowing what to look and look for requires study, study, and practice every day. However, the stock market is an inherently risky business. No amount of training or education can eliminate that risk.

In addition, you should also note that professional traders can use algorithms to act on reliable signals much faster than novice traders. Therefore, an opportunity that you identify on a candlestick chart will almost certainly close before you have a chance to make money on it. All in all, it's basically impossible to beat the market, except with luck. However, many traders swear by technical analysis and charting, or just enjoy the excitement of trading stocks.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the future movements of a stock; All trades carry risks, including the risk of losing your initial investment. Fully research this and other approaches like fundamental analysis before investing.
