The value of major cryptocurrencies — including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and ripple — fell on Wednesday July 14 after China's Anhui province announced sweeping plans to ban crypto mining, new region to block power-hungry activity as Beijing steps up its crackdown on the industry. The pressures of the past few weeks are starting to take hold as trading volumes at the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges drop by more than 40% in June.

Cryptocurrencies are not doing well after spending the past two months navigating an attack that destroyed about half the value of the world's largest tokens, due to international attention to the impact. environment of cryptocurrency mining and the growing crackdown in China. Last month saw Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, lose more than 6% on the month and drop to its lowest price since December at $28,600 on June 22, when daily volume was highest at 138, $2 billion, down 42% from the May high. Ethereum lost 15%, while the Doge meme coin is down more than 20% in June.

Losses have eased volatility, pushing volume down. Major crypto exchanges around the world — including Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Binance — saw trading volumes drop by more than 40% in June, according to CryptoCompare data. The ban, reported by Bloomberg and cited in state media by Reuters, is intended to help alleviate an expected power shortage in the province and address growing demand for electricity.
China is the source of the majority of the world's crypto trading — a 2020 study found that the country accounts for nearly 80% of global bitcoin activity — although Anhui is not a major location for miners. Trading volume in June fell 42.7% to $2.7 trillion and derivatives trading volume fell 40.7% to $3.2 trillion.

China's crackdown has caused a lot of fear, which is evident in the markets. The digital asset ecosystem has been hit head-on, so it's now up against the ropes versus fighting in the middle of the ring. Typically when you have big sell-offs, the participants get quite scared and withdraw their chips.
