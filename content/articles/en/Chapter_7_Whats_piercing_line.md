The Piercing Line is considered a bullish reversal pattern. It occurs in a downtrend.

Piercing Line is formed by 2 components:

- Bearish candle on Day 1

- Bullish candlestick on Day 2

The Piercing Line pattern occurs when a bullish candle on Day 2 closes above the middle of the Day 1 bearish candle.

It begins with the trade closing significantly lower than the opening price, creating a high red candle. Next, the next trading day begins with a gap down, opening below the previous close. Then, the price rises for the day to close above the midpoint of the previous day's range. This two-day pattern shows that the price is moving in a new direction.

The inverse of this Piercing Candle is called the Dark Cloud Cover, which is said to signal a bearish reversal.
