**Chapter 5:What’s spinning top?**

The Spinning Top is almost like a Doji, but with a slightly larger body and shadow.

The Spinning Top is a candlestick pattern with a short real body that is vertically centered between the long upper shadow and the lower shadow. Similar to the Doji, the Spinning Top is considered a neutral pattern, although many end in a price reversal.

A Spinning Top candlestick pattern is formed when buyers push the price up for a certain period of time and sellers push the price down for the same amount of time, but in the end the price closes very close to the opening price.

This candlestick formation signals indecision between buyers and sellers, as neither side has the upper hand, which is why it is classified as a neutral pattern, an indecision pattern. about future trends.
