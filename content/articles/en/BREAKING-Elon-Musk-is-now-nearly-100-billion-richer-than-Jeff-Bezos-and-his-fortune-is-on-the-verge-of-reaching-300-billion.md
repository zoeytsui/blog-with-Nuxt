Elon Musk could become the first person in history to have a net worth of $300 billion.

The world's richest man, Elon Musk, added more than $36 billion to his fortune on Monday 25.10.2021 after the automaker's stock rose 12.7 percent in response to Hertz's announcement that it will order 100,000 electric vehicle rental vehicles by the end of 2022.

His fortune grew by the most in a single day in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, equaling the net worth of the world's 34th richest person. According to Bloomberg, his $289 billion value puts him nearly $100 billion ahead of former No. 1 Jeff Bezos, who was worth $193 billion as of Monday.

Musk has also increased his lead over previous holders of the title of world's richest person. He is now worth $184 billion more than Warren Buffett, the world's 10th richest person, and has a more than $150 billion lead on Bill Gates, the world's fourth richest person.

Musk's net worth has now surpassed the market cap of Toyota, the world's second-largest automaker, which is valued at around $283 billion. Tesla first surpassed Toyota in terms of value in July 2020, taking the top spot.

Musk's fortune has grown by $119 billion this year as a result of the strong performance of Tesla stock as well as a recent share sale at SpaceX, which he founded, valuing the company at $100 billion. According to Bloomberg, Musk's net worth increased by $11 billion as a result of the SpaceX deal.

Tesla is currently on its longest profit streak in its 18-year history, with nine consecutive quarterly profits following last week's earnings report. In the three months ending September 30, the automaker delivered 241,300 vehicles.

Tesla surpassed a $1 trillion market cap on Monday, joining the ranks of companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Musk celebrated the achievement on Twitter, writing to his 61.4 million followers, "Wild $T1mes!"

Despite Musk's previous pledge to "own no house" and last year's announcement that he planned to sell nearly all of his physical possessions, the world's richest man has still spent some of his fortune.

Musk paid nearly $1 million for a rare 1976 Lotus Esprit sports car used in the filming of the 1977 James Bond film "The Spy Who Loved Me" at a Sotheby's auction in 2013. His collection reportedly includes a 1920 Ford Model T and a 1967 Jaguar Series 1 E-type Roadster.
