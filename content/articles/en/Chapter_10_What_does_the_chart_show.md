**What do candlestick charts represent?**

Theoretically, a candlestick represents the current market's attitude towards a stock or other security. The long body (distance between the opening and closing prices) indicates the direction of the stock's price movement.

A green high bar signals that the bulls are in control, pushing the price up. A red high bar shows that pessimism is dominating the market, dragging the price down with bearish sentiment. The short bodies show that the bulls and the bears are relatively balanced. That could indicate that momentum is slowing down. For example, a short body candle that appears after a series of high green candles could indicate that price is approaching resistance.

Candlestick shadows (lines above and below the body) also provide essential information. When a candle shadow forms, it means that traders who have tested the price higher or lower, this price will be rejected. The length of the upper shadow is the distance between the highest price of the day and the closing price. That means the higher price could not sustain itself and it fell to the closing price. For example, the stock price might have risen to $35 for a few hours, then fell back to $33, leaving a $2 candle. The fact that the higher price is rejected can convey some important information.
