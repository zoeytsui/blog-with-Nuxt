Forex is an investment that you need to know the ins and outs before venturing into it. Let's take a simple example: It's similar to the Roti canai business where you need to know the technique of spreading the bread properly and tasty and get a good response from customers. This concept is similar to Forex investing. You are advised not to start if you do not understand the latest forex market situation.

We would like to share with you about the common mistakes that are often made by newbie traders out there. Try to check if you also often make the same mistakes as below?

##### MISTAKE 1: FOREX CAN GET RICH QUICKLY

Newbie traders use high leverage at the beginning of the investment because they think, with a small capital they can double their profits in a short time. This is not true! It is undeniable that high leverage can double your profits in a short time but if the market turns around, you can also lose all your capital in the blink of an eye. Keep in mind that Forex investing is a high risk investment.

If you are ready to fight in the world of Forex, first of all, you must protect your capital by using leverage that suits your ability. Learn first how to set your leverage before entering the Forex market. It is better if you also make a "planning schedule" to grow your capital in stages.

##### MISTAKE 2: MAKE MONEY IN FOREX AS EASY AS ABC

<img align="right" width="30%" src="/images/article/Mistakes_in_Trading_Forex/2.png"></img>

If you think Forex investing is easy. Please leave this investment. It's not for you. This is because Forex investing is very complex and difficult to predict. Trend analysis charts may help but they do not promise profits. You can only make money in Forex if you really know and understand the Forex market.

We recommend you to improve your Forex investment knowledge and techniques before starting this Forex trade. Invest your money by attending forex courses/ workshops first.

##### MISTAKE 3: Too Technical

If you’re a technical person, let’s say you’ve managed to produce a perfect analysis chart (according to you). You should also often follow news releases/news announcements so that at least you know to maintain your position. You know the right time to enter or avoid that market.

##### MISTAKE 4: Stop loss

Maybe you have heard that there are some traders out there who do not like to use this stop loss because for them this SL "accelerates" losses. In fact, this SL can help to "reduce" losses. I personally think, this SL is very helpful if we put it in the right place.

##### MISTAKE 5: Cut Loss

If you start to realize and believe that the market is turning around, you should quickly make a Cut Loss. This can reduce your losses and if you feel sorry for Cut Loss. Use the SL technique so that the position will stop automatically if it reaches a certain loss.

Lastly, never stop to learn the knowledge of Forex. It doesn't matter if you learn from theory, learn from mistakes or from experience. All these processes are fun and at the same time make you mature in the world of the Forex market.
