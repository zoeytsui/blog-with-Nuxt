**1. Morning Star (Morning Star Candle)**

The Morning Star pattern is seen as a bullish reversal pattern, which usually occurs at the bottom of a downtrend. The pattern consists of three candlesticks:

-Large bearish candle (Day 1)

-Small Bullish Candle or Bearish Candle (Day 2)

-Large bullish candle (Day 3)

**Day 1**

The first part of the Morning Star reversal pattern is a large bearish red candle. On the first day, the bears are undoubtedly responsible for making new lows.

**Day 2**

The second day starts with a reduced gap. It's clear from the start of Day 2 that the bears are in control. However, those bears did not push the price much lower. The candlestick on Day 2 is quite small and can be bullish, bearish or neutral (i.e. Doji). In general, a bullish candle on Day 2 is seen as a stronger sign of an impending reversal. But the most meaningful day is Day 3.

**Day 3**

Day 3 begins with a bullish gap and the bulls are able to push the price up further, often eliminating the losses lost on Day One.

**2. Evening Star (Evening Star Candle)**

In contrast to the Morning Star, the Evening Star is a three-candle bearish reversal pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend. It is a signal of the end of an uptrend as well as a slowing down of bullish momentum before a bearish move is imminent.

The Evening Star is a bearish candlestick pattern consisting of three candles:

-Large bullish candle (Day 1)

-Small Bullish Candle or Bearish Candle (Day 2)

-Large bearish candle (Day 3)

**Day 1**

The first part of the Evening Star reversal pattern is a large bullish green candle. On day one, the bulls are at the helm for new market highs.

**Day 2**

The second day started with a bullish gap. It is clear that from the start of Day 2, the bulls are in control. However, the bulls are not pushing the price much higher. The candlestick on Day 2 is quite small and can be bullish, bearish or neutral (i.e. Doji). In general, a bearish candle on Day 2 is a stronger sign that a reversal is imminent.

**Day 3**

The most important candle occurs on Day 3. It starts with a gap down (a bearish signal) and the bears are able to force the price down even lower, often eliminating the gains seen on Day 1.
