**Chapter 3: What’s shooting star pattern?**

**What is the Shooting Star candlestick pattern?**

The Shooting Star is an Inverse Hammer at the top of an uptrend. The Shooting Star phenomenon is created when the opening price is low and the closing price is almost equal. Additionally, there is a long upper shadow, usually defined as at least twice the length of the body. When the low and the close are at/nearly equal, a bearish Shooting Star candlestick is formed.

Similar to the Hanging Man, the Shooting Star candlestick formation is seen as a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that usually occurs at the top of uptrends.
