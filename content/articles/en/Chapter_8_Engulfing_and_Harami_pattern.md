**Engulfing patterns**

Engulfing patterns are also two-day sets where the second day has higher highs and lower lows than the previous day. The color of the second candle, which must be the opposite of the color of the first candle, indicates whether it is a positive or negative sign. If the second day is green, it is considered a Bullish Engulfing pattern. If it is red, it is considered a Bearish Engulfing pattern.

**Harami**

Harami is the opposite of the Engulfing pattern. They occur when the body of the second trading day is completely within the body of the previous day and has the opposite color. A red candle followed by a tall green candle is considered a Bearish Harami. Likewise, a short green candle followed by a high red candle is considered a Bullish Harami.

Several other three-day models also appeared. For example, three consecutive long red bars are known as the Three Black Crows pattern. It is supposed to convey pessimism in the market, indicating possible further losses. The inverse, which has three long green bars in a row, is known as the Three Advancing Soldiers pattern. It shows that more profits may follow.

There are many other models that technical analysts use to predict the direction of a stock. These alternative chart forms are typically longer term than candlestick patterns, based on price changes over several trading days. A common identifier of such a pattern is known as the Elliott Wave Theory, which holds that stock prices move in a recognizable sequence of impulses and corrections.
