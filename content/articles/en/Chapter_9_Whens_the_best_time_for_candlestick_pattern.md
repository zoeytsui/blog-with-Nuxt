When is the best time frame for candlesticks?
Candlesticks often create two- or three-day patterns that technical traders analyze. There are a few single candlestick patterns, but most take longer to form.

Because candlesticks are short-term, they suggest a reversal or short-term continuation of a trend. Candlesticks usually don't tell you anything useful for more than a few days following a pattern. Therefore, it is less likely to form a candlestick that identifies an ongoing long-term trend. Much of it is likely to signal temporary changes in momentum.

In this way, candlesticks can be more useful in short-intraday trading than long-term investing.
