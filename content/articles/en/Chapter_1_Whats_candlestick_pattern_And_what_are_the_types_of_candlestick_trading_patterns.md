**Candlestick series. What’s candlestick pattern and which is the most reliable?**

#### Chapter 1: Candlestick pattern

Candlestick patterns, in the context of stock trading, are a visual representation of the range of movements in a stock's price during a trading day. The body of the candle represents the difference between the opening and closing prices. The color of the body indicates whether the price rose or fell during the trading day. Green indicates profit (bull/bull), while red indicates loss (bear/bear). If the price rises, the opening price is at the bottom of the body. If it falls, the price opens at the top. The highest and lowest prices for the day show up as the upper and lower lines of the candle body or "shadow", sometimes called the wick or the tail.

**What is candlestick pattern?**

In stock trading, candlesticks are an illustration of the daily movements of a stock's price. The length of the bar tells you the difference between the opening and closing prices. Lines extending beyond the bar, sometimes called shadows, wicks, or tails, indicate whether the price will extend higher or lower than the open or close before the retracement. The color of the candlestick tells you if the stock closed higher or lower than the opening price.

These candlesticks originated in Japan more than two centuries ago. Munehisa Homma used drawings to show how much the price of rice fluctuated in a day. It was not until the 1980s that these drawings became known in the West. Steve Nison introduced them as “Japanese Candlestick Techniques” in a book of the same name. The idea behind candlesticks is that patterns emerge, which a sophisticated trader can spot. Those patterns are said to signal an impending trend, reversal, and breakout (price is outside the normal range of volatility).

**What are the types of candlestick trading patterns?**

Candlestick trading patterns come in many shapes and sizes. In theory, day-to-day fluctuations can reveal market sentiment. Some form inside candlesticks is said to indicate a change in momentum and attitude. For example, after a series of losses, a particular pattern might suggest that the market is moving from fear to hope. If true, the market could soon reverse and start a rally.

Steve Nison (considered an expert in candlesticks) lists 47 candlestick patterns on his website. Here are some of the more popular patterns that are well known.
