The Hanging Man candlestick pattern, as you might have guessed from its name, is seen as a bearish reversal pattern, showing that selling pressure is increasing and the price may fall.

The Hanging Man pattern is like a Hammer, a hammer at the top of an uptrend. The Hanging Man is created when the opening price is high and the closing price is almost the same. In addition, a short body on top with a long lower shadow should be at least twice the length of the real body and a small or no upper shadow. This pattern mainly occurs at the top of uptrends and can act as a warning of a possible bearish reversal. What happens the next day after the Hanging Man pattern is what gives traders an idea of ​​whether the price will be higher or lower. It is important to emphasize that the Hanging Man pattern is a warning of possible price changes rather than a signal to buy short.
