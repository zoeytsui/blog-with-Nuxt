No system can accurately predict future movements of stocks. However, according to the Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts by Thomas Bulkowski, the Three-Line Strike is the most reliable candlestick pattern.

**So what is the Three Line Strike pattern?**

Three Line Strike is a trend continuation candlestick pattern consisting of four candles. Depending on their height and location, it is possible to predict the continuation of an uptrend or downtrend.

**Three Line Strike's bullish continuation is noted if:**

- The first three candles are long and bullish and continue the uptrend with a higher close;

- The second and third candles open within the body of the previous candle;

- The fourth candle is a bearish candle, opening at a new High;

- The closing price of the fourth candle is lower than the opening price of the first candle.

**Three Line Strike's bearish continuation is noted if:**

- The first three candles are long and bearish and continue the downtrend with a lower closing price;

- The second and third candles open within the body of the previous candle;

- The fourth candle is bullish, opening at a new Low;

- The closing price of the fourth candle is higher than the opening price of the first candle.

Although this is the most reliable signal, according to experts, it is only true in 67% of bearish signals and 65% of bullish signals. This pattern is also relatively rare, which limits its usefulness.
