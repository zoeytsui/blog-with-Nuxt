Congratulations! It seems that you are increasingly interested in learning more about this foreign currency trading investment. Surely you are wondering when is the right time to sell or buy that currency pair right?

Here, we will use some examples that are easy for you to understand by using some examples of frequently traded currency pairs.

We use fundamental analysis to decide whether to sell or buy.  

**EUR/USD**

In this Example, the EUR is the base currency for this currency pair and the determinant of whether to sell or buy. If you predict that the US economy will continue to weaken and adversely affect the US Dollar, you can Buy this pair. By doing so, you have bought the EUR and expect the EUR to be stronger against the USD.

On the other hand, if you predict the US economy will be strong and will have a positive impact on the US Dollar. So, you should sell this pair. With that, you have sold the EUR and predicted it would be weaker against the US Dollar.

**USD/JPY**

In this example, USD is the base currency for this currency pair and the determinant of whether to sell or buy. If you predict that the Japanese economy and the Yen currency continue to weaken. You should buy this pair. You believe that the USD will be stronger against the Yen.

If you predict Japanese investors have exited the US Financial Markets and re -converted their capital from the US Dollar to the Yen. Then you have to sell this pair. This is because you believe that the Yen will be stronger against the US Dollar.

Or in other words, you have to make purchases and sales at the right price and then resell it at a better price. Make sure you buy at a cheap price and sell it at a high price. This is a great way to make a profit in Forex.
