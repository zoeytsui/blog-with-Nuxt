**Chapter 4: What’s Doji pattern?**

A Doji, also known as a Doji star — or more accurately, a "dо̄ji" — is a phenomenon that occurs when the opening and closing prices are nearly the same, meaning the candle has no body. Doji candles look like a star, cross, cross or plus sign. The Doji candle is a unique type of candlestick that represents indecision in the forex market. Neither the bulls nor the bears are in control. In Japanese, "doji" means error or mistake, referring to how rarely the opening and closing prices are exactly the same.

However, the Doji candlestick has five variations and not all of them indicate indecision. That is why it is important to understand how these candles form and what this could mean for future price movements in the forex market.

This article explains what a Doji candlestick is and introduces five different types of Doji used in forex trading. It will also cover top strategies for trading using Doji candles.

**5 types of Doji candlestick patterns** 

1. Doji Star (Standard Doji)

3. Dragonfly Doji (Dragonfly Doji)

4. Gravestone Doji (Tombstone Doji)

5. The 4 Price Doji (4 Price Doji)
