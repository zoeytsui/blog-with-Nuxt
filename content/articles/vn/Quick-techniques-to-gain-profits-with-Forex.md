***Copy Trading***

Perhaps this is one of the easiest Forex techniques for a Newbie or for those who do not have much time to trade. This method allows you to copy trades that have been carried out by selected skilled individuals. With this method, you can copy the trading of an experienced trader directly and your performance will be the same as the individual you have chosen. But, this method will cause you not to learn Forex techniques as you will become overly dependent on individuals.

***Choose a popular currency pair***

We all trade because we want to make a profit. Therefore, choose a currency pair that is popular in the market. For example: EUR/USD or USD/JPY.

The pair is popular among traders because of its easy -to -read movements. Making analysis comparisons is also easier as many traders have done this analysis.

***Candlesticks & Support and Resistance (SNR)***

This technique is very important and newbies must master this technique and practice always in order to further sharpen their trading skills. Learn both of these sciences in more depth. This technique is also known as price action. Where when the price has reached a certain level, it will turn back or continue on its journey.

***Trade at the right time***

You should know the basics of geography when trading Forex. This is because if you trade EUR/USD but you enter MT4 at 9 am (Malaysian time). Of course the movement is very slow. This is because people in Europe are still asleep. The best time to trade is 8 PM - 12 AM (Malaysian time). This time the market is very active where selling and buying activities take place.



***Fundamental Analysis***

Fundamental analysis is to analyze the economic situation of a country. Traders rely entirely on the well -being of a country, the news, the country’s GDP and inflation before starting their trading. This fundamental analysis is a medium to long term trade. This is because it takes time for economic activity to take place in the market.

***Technical Analysis***

This technique is more focused on price trend analysis, statistical data and Forex market activity. The trading time for this technique is usually shorter. Traders who practice this technique believe that history is likely to repeat itself. Therefore, price trends are very important to them.

***Scalping***

` `In Scalping, traders usually open many trades in a day in order to take advantage of small price movements. The main key to becoming a scalping trader is to believe and be confident in yourself. For example, a 1-minute price chart and expect to make a profit through a small movement.

***Swing***

Swing trading can be considered as the result of a combination of Fundamental analysis techniques and Technical analysis. Where they use technical analysis to analyse past price events and fundamental analysis to predict how economic events will affect the forex market in a few days or weeks.

***Conclusion***

Now, you know the techniques that can be used in the Forex market. Before starting to trade, you should prepare yourself with thorough trading skills. Also, as a newbie, it is best to start with a small capital as a start. Most importantly, don’t expect immediate success because this Forex journey is long and takes time to succeed.
